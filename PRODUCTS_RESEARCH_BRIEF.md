## Integration with Existing Architecture

### Current Node Structure
```typescript
// Existing pattern from order filtering
{
    displayName: 'Resource',
    name: 'resource',
    type: 'options',
    options: [
        { name: 'Customer', value: 'customer' },
        { name: 'Order', value: 'order' },
        { name: 'Product', value: 'product' }, // Expand this
    ]
}
```

### Proposed Product Operations
```typescript
// Expanded product operations
product_operations = [
    'get', 'getAll', 'search',           // Current
    'create', 'update', 'delete',        // Basic CRUD
    'duplicate', 'publish', 'unpublish', // Advanced
    'bulkUpdate', 'bulkCreate',          // Bulk operations
    // Variant operations
    'createVariant', 'updateVariant', 'deleteVariant',
    // Metafield operations  
    'getMetafields', 'createMetafield', 'updateMetafield',
    // Inventory operations
    'updateInventory', 'adjustInventory'
];
```

## Timeline and Next Steps
