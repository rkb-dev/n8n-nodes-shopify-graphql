# Dynamic Fetching Research Brief: n8n + Shopify GraphQL

## Research Objective
Research and specify all dynamic fetching capabilities (`loadOptions` methods) that should be implemented for the Shopify GraphQL n8n node to provide optimal UX. Focus exclusively on n8n technical patterns and Shopify GraphQL API capabilities.

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… **COMPLETED:**
- `loadMetafields.ts` - Dynamic metafield definition loading
- `loadProducts.ts` - Dynamic product selection with status indicators
- `loadCustomers.ts` - Dynamic customer selection with state indicators

ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS:**
- Methods created but not yet integrated into node field definitions
- No `loadOptions` properties added to fields yet
- Methods index file not created

## Research Requirements

### A. **n8n Dynamic Loading Technical Patterns**

#### **1. loadOptions Method Implementation**
Research the complete technical specification for n8n `loadOptions`:
- **Method signature**: Exact TypeScript interface and return types
- **Error handling**: Best practices for API failures and graceful degradation
- **Caching**: When and how n8n caches dynamic options
- **Performance**: Optimal query sizes and pagination for large datasets
- **Credential context**: How loadOptions methods access Shopify credentials

#### **2. Field Definition Integration**
Research how to properly integrate `loadOptions` into node field definitions:
- **loadOptionsMethod property**: Exact syntax and configuration
- **Conditional loading**: Loading options based on other field values
- **Multi-level dependencies**: Fields that depend on multiple other selections
- **Default value handling**: How to set defaults with dynamic options
- **Validation**: Client-side validation of dynamically loaded values

#### **3. Advanced n8n Patterns**
Research advanced dynamic loading patterns:
- **loadNodeParameters**: Pre-populating fields with existing data for updates
- **Background loading**: Non-blocking data fetching techniques
- **Incremental loading**: Loading data as users navigate through options
- **Search/filter integration**: Dynamic filtering of large option lists

### B. **Shopify GraphQL Dynamic Data Sources**

#### **1. Core Resource Loading**
Research optimal GraphQL queries for dynamic loading:
- **Products**: Query optimization, field selection, pagination strategies
- **Customers**: Efficient customer loading with relevant display data
- **Orders**: Dynamic order selection for relationships and updates
- **Collections**: Product collections for organization and filtering
- **Locations**: Store locations for inventory and fulfillment

#### **2. Metadata and Configuration Loading**
Research Shopify-specific dynamic data:
- **Metafield Definitions**: Namespace/key discovery, type validation
- **Product Variants**: Existing variant loading for updates
- **Inventory Locations**: Available locations for stock management
- **Sales Channels**: Active sales channels for order filtering
- **Payment Gateways**: Configured payment methods
- **Shipping Zones**: Configured shipping zones and methods

#### **3. Relationship Data Loading**
Research relational data for complex operations:
- **Product â†’ Variants**: Loading variants for specific products
- **Customer â†’ Orders**: Loading orders for specific customers
- **Order â†’ Line Items**: Loading line items for order updates
- **Collection â†’ Products**: Loading products in specific collections

### C. **UX Optimization Research**

#### **1. Display Optimization**
Research optimal display patterns for Shopify data:
- **Status indicators**: Visual cues for active/inactive/draft states
- **Hierarchical display**: Showing relationships (product â†’ variants)
- **Search and filtering**: Built-in search for large option lists
- **Sorting strategies**: Optimal sorting for different data types

#### **2. Performance Optimization**
Research performance best practices:
- **Query batching**: Combining multiple data requests
- **Field selection**: Minimal field sets for dropdown display
- **Pagination limits**: Optimal page sizes for different data types
- **Caching strategies**: When to cache vs. real-time loading

#### **3. Error Handling and Fallbacks**
Research robust error handling:
- **API rate limiting**: Handling Shopify GraphQL cost limits
- **Network failures**: Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- **Permission errors**: Handling insufficient API scopes
- **Empty states**: UX for stores with no data (new stores)

## Specific Research Questions

### **1. Priority Dynamic Methods**
Which dynamic loading methods provide the highest UX impact?
- **High Priority**: Essential for basic functionality
- **Medium Priority**: Significant UX improvement
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have enhancements

### **2. Technical Implementation**
- How should the methods index file be structured for optimal imports?
- What's the best pattern for conditional dynamic loading?
- How to handle dynamic loading in collections vs. individual fields?
- What's the optimal error handling pattern for loadOptions methods?

### **3. Shopify GraphQL Optimization**
- What are the most efficient GraphQL queries for each dynamic method?
- How to handle Shopify's cost-based rate limiting in dynamic loading?
- Which fields should be included for optimal display vs. performance?
- How to implement incremental loading for large datasets?

### **4. Integration Strategy**
- Which existing fields should be converted from static to dynamic?
- How to maintain backward compatibility during the transition?
- What's the testing strategy for dynamic loading functionality?
- How to document dynamic loading for users and contributors?

## Expected Deliverables

### **1. Complete Dynamic Methods Specification**
- List of all recommended dynamic methods with priorities
- Technical specifications for each method
- GraphQL query optimization for each data source
- Error handling and fallback strategies

### **2. Integration Implementation Plan**
- Step-by-step integration plan for existing fields
- New field definitions with loadOptions properties
- Methods index file structure and exports
- Testing and validation approach

### **3. Performance and UX Guidelines**
- Best practices for query optimization
- UX patterns for different data types
- Error handling and user feedback strategies
- Caching and performance optimization recommendations

## Research Constraints

### **FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON:**
- n8n loadOptions technical patterns and best practices
- Shopify GraphQL Admin API capabilities and optimization
- Direct integration between n8n and Shopify GraphQL
- Performance optimization for the specific use case

### **DO NOT RESEARCH:**
- Other e-commerce platforms or APIs
- Shopify REST API (we're GraphQL-only)
- Generic dropdown/UI patterns not specific to n8n
- Other n8n node types unless directly relevant to loadOptions patterns

## Success Criteria
The research is complete when we have:
1. âœ… Complete specification of all recommended dynamic methods
2. âœ… Technical implementation details for n8n integration
3. âœ… Optimized GraphQL queries for each dynamic data source
4. âœ… Clear prioritization and implementation roadmap
5. âœ… Performance and UX optimization guidelines

This research will enable the completion of dynamic fetching implementation and significantly improve the Shopify GraphQL node's user experience.
