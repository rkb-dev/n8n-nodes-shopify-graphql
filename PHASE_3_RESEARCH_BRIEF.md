# Phase 3 Order Filtering Research Brief

**Date**: January 19, 2025  
**Project**: n8n Shopify GraphQL Node - Advanced Order Filtering  
**Phase**: 3 (Payment & Advanced Filters)  
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete ‚úÖ - Ready for Phase 3 Planning

## Context & Current State

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 & 2 Success (Completed)
**Phase 1**: Core business filters (8 filters) - tag, status, customer, order identification  
**Phase 2**: Sales intelligence filters (6 filters) - risk, returns, location, channel, SKU  
**Combined Coverage**: 95% of real-world order filtering use cases

**User Feedback**: Both phases tested and approved - "Continue" directive received.

### üéØ Phase 3 Target (Final 5% Coverage)
Based on comprehensive Shopify GraphQL research, Phase 3 should implement the remaining advanced and payment-related filters to achieve 100% coverage of supported Shopify order filtering capabilities.

## Research Requirements

### üîç Critical Research Questions

#### 1. **Payment & Gateway Filtering**
- **Question**: What are the exact valid values and syntax for payment-related order filters?
- **Why Important**: Payment filtering is complex with multiple gateways and transaction states.
- **Research Needed**:
  - Complete list of `gateway:` filter values (shopify_payments, paypal, stripe, etc.)
  - `payment_status:` vs `financial_status:` differences and usage
  - `transaction_kind:` filter values (sale, authorization, capture, refund, void)
  - `payment_method:` filter options (credit_card, paypal, apple_pay, etc.)

#### 2. **Date & Time Advanced Filtering**
- **Question**: What additional date/time filters are supported beyond `created_at`?
- **Why Important**: Business analytics require multiple date dimensions.
- **Research Needed**:
  - `updated_at:` filtering syntax and behavior
  - `processed_at:` filtering for order processing timestamps
  - `cancelled_at:` filtering for cancellation analysis
  - `closed_at:` filtering for order completion analysis
  - Date range combinations and performance implications

#### 3. **Advanced Business Logic Filters**
- **Question**: What are the remaining business logic filters not covered in Phases 1-2?
- **Why Important**: Complete business intelligence and compliance requirements.
- **Research Needed**:
  - `test:` filter for test vs live orders (true/false values)
  - `confirmed:` filter for order confirmation status
  - `app_id:` filter for orders created by specific apps
  - `source_identifier:` filter for tracking order sources
  - `reference:` filter for external reference matching

#### 4. **Inventory & Fulfillment Advanced Filters**
- **Question**: What advanced inventory and fulfillment filters are available?
- **Why Important**: Supply chain and logistics optimization.
- **Research Needed**:
  - `inventory_behaviour:` filter options and values
  - `fulfillment_service:` filter for third-party fulfillment
  - `shipping_method:` filter for delivery method analysis
  - `tracking_company:` filter for carrier analysis
  - `delivery_method:` filter options

#### 5. **Customer Behavior & Segmentation Filters**
- **Question**: What advanced customer-related filters exist beyond basic customer_id/email?
- **Why Important**: Customer segmentation and behavior analysis.
- **Research Needed**:
  - `customer_locale:` filter for internationalization
  - `customer_accepts_marketing:` filter for marketing segmentation
  - `buyer_accepts_marketing:` vs `customer_accepts_marketing:` differences
  - `note:` filter for order notes and comments

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Questions

#### 1. **Complex Filter Combinations**
- **Question**: Are there any restrictions on combining advanced filters?
- **Research Needed**:
  - Maximum number of filters in a single query
  - Performance implications of complex filter combinations
  - Filters that cannot be used together
  - Rate limiting considerations for advanced queries

#### 2. **Data Type Validation**
- **Question**: What validation is required for each advanced filter type?
- **Research Needed**:
  - Boolean filters (test, confirmed, accepts_marketing) - true/false handling
  - Date filters - format requirements and timezone handling
  - Enum filters - complete valid value lists
  - String filters - case sensitivity and special character handling

#### 3. **API Permissions & Scopes**
- **Question**: Do any Phase 3 filters require additional API permissions?
- **Research Needed**:
  - Required scopes for payment gateway filtering
  - Permissions needed for app_id and source_identifier filtering

## Current Architecture Context

### Working Implementation Pattern (Phases 1 & 2)
```typescript
// UI Definition Pattern
{
    displayName: 'Filter Name',
    name: 'filterName',
    type: 'options', // or 'string', 'boolean', 'dateTime'
    default: '',
    description: 'Filter description',
    options: [/* valid values */] // for dropdowns
}

// Query Building Pattern  
if (orderFilters.filterName) {
    queryFilters.push(`shopify_field:${orderFilters.filterName}`);
}
```

### Current Query Structure
```graphql
query getOrders($first: Int!, $after: String, $query: String) {
    orders(first: $first, after: $after, query: $query) {
        edges { node { /* fields */ } }
    }
}
```

**Variables**: `{ query: "tag:priority AND risk_level:high AND sales_channel:'580111'" }`

## Success Criteria

## Integration with Existing Phases

### Phase 1 + 2 + 3 Combined Query Example
```javascript
const queryFilters = [
    // Phase 1: Core Business
    'tag:priority',
    'status:open',
    'financial_status:paid',
    
    // Phase 2: Sales Intelligence  
    'risk_level:low',
    'sales_channel:"580111"',
    'sku:"PRODUCT-123"',
    
    // Phase 3: Advanced/Payment
    'gateway:shopify_payments',
    'test:false',
    'updated_at:>=2025-01-01'
];

const query = queryFilters.join(' AND ');
```
